# Roll-The-Dice-Game
A fun and interactive Dice Rolling Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a simple yet entertaining game where players roll two dice and try to accumulate points. The first player to reach a predefined score (100 points) wins!


Roll the Dice: Players take turns to roll two dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
Accumulation of Points: The total score of both dice is added to the player's current round score.
Hold to Save Points: Players can choose to hold their current round score, adding it to their total score, and switch the turn to the other player.
Risk of Rolling a 1: If any of the dice rolls a 1, the player loses all points accumulated in the current round and the turn is passed to the other player.
Winning the Game: The first player to reach a predefined score (100 points) wins the game.
